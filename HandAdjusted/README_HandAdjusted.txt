This folder contains images that have been hand adjusted.

The left side show the original image. The right side shows the adjust image.

These were adjusted by an engineer, not a photographer or artist! Aesthetic sensibilities are in question. The purpose here is to show that fine adjustment beyond what is produced by the automatic recipes is possible. 

In particular, the following image numbers are thought to be better results than the same images presented in filed '93Contrast'94 , although the difference may be hard to see:

01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 07, 13, 14, 28
